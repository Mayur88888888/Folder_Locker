# Folder_Locker
Folder locker with batch file. It was created long a ago for Windows 7.
This project is just for study purpose how you can apply simple tricks to keep your files safe.
Still many changes are required to be done to actually lock this folder like changing permissions and changing the Owner of the folder and Sub folders, so that it can not be deleted easily.
In upcoming updates, I will add few features to make these changes automatically.
